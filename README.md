# Drawing on the Web

## Final Project

### By: Alexa Goldman

I have changed my project last minute. I have created four pages that revolve around my love for space. The first page is my nagivation page. Using javascript, I have a png logo of my "branding" that moves horizontally from left to right. There is a navigation bar on top, an "enter the site" svg button and the footer has the links to the next pages.  The next page is the moon page. I have created the phases of the moon with svgs and have a video as the background. In the center I have again my logo and if you click the planet, it will lead you to the rocket page. The rocket page has again a video background and uses css animation to move the two rockets across the screen. There is also a navigation bar on top that you can use to get to the saturn page. The saturn page was inpired from looking around at some of my old p5 classwork from interactive computing. We always use particle systems so I created a system of stars that move on the canvas and saturn in the middle and also moves. This was created using Three.JS.

I will be graduating in a few short weeks and I still lack a reliable job post-grad. For the past three semesters I have taken several courses that have driven me to want to pursue front-end engineering. Although I have a decent portfolio to show future employers, it can be better. Drawing on the Web has shown me many new techniques to make a better portfolio. I want to make a brand for myself and with this final project I'm going to take advantage of that. 

The first page I intend to create is an entrance/welcome page where the visitor has to click a SVG enter button. This page will also have other SVGs or even a Javascript animation based off my theme/brand. This will lead the visitor to the home page that will display my work and designs. It will have a navigation on top that will lead you to my about page and any other pages I create if time allows. The about page will have another generated graphic that I will create and will showcase who I am. For example it could be a css animation of me hurdling in a track and field race, a lesser known fact about me, or I can explore new Javascript techniques and libraries. If time allows Iâ€™d like to get a working contact page where the visitor can directly email me and a resume page, both will also include a my theme/brand but with a different technique. My whole goal for this project is to incorporate almost every topic we have discussed this semester, maybe even force me to explore new techniques and have a solid foundation for a professional portfolio that I can continue to build on in the future.
