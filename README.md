# Drawing on the Web

## Final Project

### By: Alexa Goldman


I will be graduating in a few short weeks and I still lack a reliable job post-grad. For the past three semesters I have taken several courses that have driven me to want to pursue front-end engineering. Although I have a decent portfolio to show future employers, it can be better. Drawing on the Web has shown me many new techniques to make a better portfolio. I want to make a brand for myself and with this final project I'm going to take advantage of that. 

The first page I intend to create is an entrance/welcome page where the visitor has to click a SVG enter button. This page will also have other SVGs or even a Javascript animation based off my theme/brand. This will lead the visitor to the home page that will display my work and designs. It will have a navigation on top that will lead you to my about page and any other pages I create if time allows. The about page will have another generated graphic that I will create and will showcase who I am. For example it could be a css animation of me hurdling in a track and field race, a lesser known fact about me, or I can explore new Javascript techniques and libraries. If time allows Iâ€™d like to get a working contact page where the visitor can directly email me and a resume page, both will also include a my theme/brand but with a different technique. My whole goal for this project is to incorporate almost every topic we have discussed this semester, maybe even force me to explore new techniques and have a solid foundation for a professional portfolio that I can continue to build on in the future.
